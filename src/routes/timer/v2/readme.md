# Note

This is the version Joy of Code showed, thought i'd include it for reference as I did v1 on my own.
I seem to default towards flex box all the way compared to using grid where it makes more sense.

Note on the Joy of code version:

- it seems more succint, but mine was more feature full, plus there are some further bugs in the JoC version like spamming the reset will cumulatively add timeouts so time will go faster as there are multiple additions to elapsed
- I like the use of progress, I didn't know of this so made my own.
- I use a lot of divs to layout my page as I don't yet get grid layouts.
